# Procedural-Terrain

A Work-In-Progress personal project where I'm learning procedural terrain generation and experiment with it, using Unity.

So far, it can generate a terrain heightmap using Perlin Noise and octaves, display it as a 2D flat Texture and a 3D Mesh, 
and color them using a color gradient.

Example screenshots of a generated terrain :
